FIT: Fridge Inventory Tracker

FIT is an intelligent IoT-based inventory management system designed to automate kitchen tracking. By combining an ESP32-CAM, Google Vertex AI (Gemini), Firebase, and a Flutter mobile app, FIT automatically detects when items are added or removed from your fridge and categorizes them in real-time.

🌟 Features

Automated Tracking: Detects motion and records video/images of items entering or leaving the fridge.

AI-Powered Recognition: Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to identify food items and determine the action (Added vs. Removed).

Smart Categorization: Automatically sorts items into categories like Fruit, Vegetables, Dairy, Seafood, etc.

Batch Alerts: If multiple items are changed at once, the app triggers a review popup to ensure accuracy.

Multi-User & Security: Secure login/signup with strict data ownership rules (users only see their own items).

Cost & Waste Control: Helps prevent food waste and saves money by tracking what you have.

Cross-Platform App: Beautiful mobile interface built with Flutter (Android/iOS).

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Hardware:

ESP32-CAM module (AI-Thinker model recommended)

HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor

5V Power Supply (Recommended to use 5V/3V power adapter for breadboards or Battery) 

MicroSD Card (formatted to FAT32) for buffering video

Breadboard

Jumper Wire

Software & Tools:

Flutter SDK: Required to build and run the mobile app.

Node.js & npm: Required to deploy Firebase Cloud Functions.

Python 3.9+: Required to run/deploy the AI Service.

Arduino IDE: Required to flash and upload code to the ESP32-CAM.

Google Cloud CLI: For deploying Cloud Run services.

Firebase CLI: For deploying Functions, Rules, and managing the project.

# Step 1: Google Cloud & Firebase Setup

Create a Project: Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Enable APIs:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Enable Vertex AI API, Cloud Run API, Cloud Build API, Artifact Registry API, and Cloud Functions API.

Firebase Services:

Authentication: Enable "Email/Password" sign-in provider.

Firestore: Create a database in production mode.

Storage: Create a default storage bucket.

# Step 2: AI Backend Setup (Cloud Run)

This service processes videos using Gemini.

Navigate to the directory:

cd ai_service


Update main.py: Replace PROJECT_ID with your actual Google Cloud Project ID.

Build and Deploy:

1. Submit Build
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/inventory-ai-service .

2. Deploy Service (Copy the Service URL for the next step)
gcloud run deploy inventory-ai-service --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/inventory-ai-service --platform managed --region asia-southeast1 --no-allow-unauthenticated


# Step 3: Firebase Functions Setup

This connects Firebase Storage uploads to your AI Service.

Navigate to the directory:

cd functions


Install dependencies:

npm install


Update src/index.ts:

Set CLOUD_RUN_URL to the URL you got from Step 2.

Ensure the bucket name matches your Firebase Storage bucket.

Deploy Functions & Rules:

firebase deploy


Grant Permission: Allow your Cloud Function to talk to Cloud Run.

Find your project number: gcloud projects describe YOUR_PROJECT_ID

Run:

gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding inventory-ai-service --member="serviceAccount:YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/run.invoker" --region=asia-southeast1


# Step 4: Hardware Setup (ESP32)

Open esp32_cam_inventory_v9_avi.ino in Arduino IDE.

Install Libraries:

FirebaseClient (by Mobizt)

ESP32 board definitions (by Espressif)

Update Configuration:

Set FIREBASE_USER_EMAIL and PASSWORD (create a dummy account in Firebase Auth for the camera).

Set API_KEY (Project Settings -> General -> Web API Key).

Set STORAGE_BUCKET.

Flash: Connect GPIO0 to GND, press Reset, click Upload. Remove jumper after uploading.

Usage: On first boot, if Wi-Fi fails, it starts a BLE server named "InventoryFridge-Setup". Use the mobile app to connect and provision Wi-Fi.

# Step 5: Mobile App Setup (Flutter)

Navigate to the app folder:

Install Dependencies:

flutter pub get


Run the App:

flutter run


🧹 Cost Optimization (Lifecycle Rules)

To prevent high storage costs, this project automatically deletes uploaded videos after 2 days.

Create a file named lifecycle.json with this content:

{
  "rule": [{ "action": {"type": "Delete"}, "condition": {"age": 2} }]
}


Apply the rule to your bucket:

gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.appspot.com


📱 App Usage

Register: Create an account in the app.

Connect Device: Go to the "Device" tab, scan for your ESP32 via BLE, and pass your Wi-Fi credentials.

Track: Place items in front of the camera. The app will update automatically.

Review: If many items change at once (>3), a "Batch Update" popup will appear for you to confirm the changes.
